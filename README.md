## Learning how to use one-dimensional arrays

The premise for the lab revolves around two players racing. Each player will start at a
random location on a track that is 18 long. Each player will alternate movement and the first player to get to the end of the
track 5 times wins. Each time a player lands on the same spot as another player, that player moving sends the prior
player back to spot 0.
